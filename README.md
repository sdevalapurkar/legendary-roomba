# The Legendary Roomba

Software for controlling a Roomba robot! It can shoot lasers and do other cool stuff too

# Components and Programs

These are some simple programs and components used as part of the larger project in building out the functionality of the legendary roomba:

## UART Loopback

Simple program that does a "loop back" from UART0 to UART1 and back out from UART1 to UART0. Whatever you enter from your laptop will eventually echo back to the console via UART1.

## Bluetooth Loopback

Using two bluetooth modules for sending/receiving 32 characters from a base station wirelessly to another remote station and back.
